			BMMIX 0.1-1
NEW FEATURES
	o the model can now move unsampled frequencies independently from
	the sampled groups.

	o minimum non-zero frequencies allowed in sampled groups when not
	moving the frequencies - avoiding -Inf log-likelihoods when groups
	in the response are not in the candidate origins.




			BMMIX 0.1-0
NEW FEATURES
	o first beta release of bmmix - this package is not ready to use yet!

	o the function bmmix implements a Bayesian multinomial mixture
	model; the initial application is forensic: trying to identify the
